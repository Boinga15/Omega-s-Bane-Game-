# Omega-s-Bane-Game-
An RPG style game I created in C++. Feel free to edit it and create your own forks and branches. Some things need improvements. Read README file for more.

Omega's Bane is an RPG style game made in C++ where you explore a cave and must defeat Omega to stop him from getting into the world. Upgrade your stats, learn new techniques, and slay countless enemies on your quest for victory.

There are alot of things I'll improve on in the future such as balancing issues. I'll be working on this over time, but for now, feel free to branch of from this project and create your own forks and versions. This is my first large game which also happens to use concepts I'm still not familiar with (coding-wise), so the code may be a little messy or inefficient. Besides that, I found this game to be quite fun, so maybe even if you don't want to improve it, you can play it.

Have fun playing or coding!
